# Introduction to Deep learning and CNNs
This part of the tutorial will introduce a simple CNN to classify the [cifar10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. Therefore we build a CNN to solve a classification task with 10 classes using the RGB images as direct input features.

## Running the code

In your terminal, go to the directory ***DL_tutorial*** and open the notebook with this command:

```
KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE jupyter notebook CNN_tutorial.ipynb 
```

In the notebook: Select the Python 3 kernel by clicking on: ```Kernel/Change_kernel/Python_3``

**NOW YOU ARE READY TO GO!**

Follow the instructions in the notebook:
* Run cell by cell individually
* Complete the missing parts of the code
* Answer/discuss the questions

NOTE: In the end you can export the notebook as an html file: File/Download_as/HTML
